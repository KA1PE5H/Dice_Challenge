# Dice_Challenge
This is Dice Challenge, which has been built with the use of DOM concepts in javascript, and some logical operations to decide the winner.

So at first a random nmber is assigned to both the players and the one who gets a bigger number wins, and the other one loses. But if the randomly generated number turn out to be the same then "Draw" is displayed.

If you wish to tes it out yourself, please head over [here](https://ka1pe5h.github.io/Dice_Challenge/).

Happy coding ;)
